Building AI based solution for Biometrics

## Summary

This project will lead to intelligent idea of getting international students to enroll for their 'BIOMETRIC' verfication from their personal systems such as laptop, smart phone or  tablet


## Background

This idea would solve the problem of not being able to access "Visa Application Centres- VACs" during pandemic. A lot of international studnets are stranded and waiting for VACs to open.From past 2 years this problem is prevalent and is now quite frequent due to intermittent lock-downs. My personal motivation is to smooth the entire STUDent VISA application process to be artificially driven once the VISA officer has made a decision.This topic is important and also interesting, as education sector and international students drive a large share of any country's economy

List of current issues challenges and problems faced:
* problem 1- International Studnets have to wait and differ their decisions on college enrollement due to PANDEMIC Biometric Centres being shut 
* problem 2- VAC's unable to handle applications to process indivdual biometrics due to less staffing
* problem 3- Delay in the process of VISA issuance and PASSPORT stamping


## How is it used?

The process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

VFS Global and Embassy to incorporate AI based software that will scan retina & finger prints from your portable home device using the APPLICATION "APP"
In situations where a physical VFS or VAC centres are not able to operate.
The users are predominantly all international students/travellers
The needs to be accounted are - Time from the registartion for Biometrics and ease of processing it.
In an event, if some one can not access a physical centres, this app to be downlaoded and should be linked with tyour 'National identity".
To scan finger print, the app will ask you to use each finger and press on your mobile screen untill it scans for its authenticity.

## Data sources and AI methods
The data for the sources for such a solution is already available with VFS and all Embassies.
## Challenges

The only limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this are 
1- Data validity.
2- Misuse of artifical products for any one to escape their criminal records.
3- Forge data from server and misuse it for other purposes

## What next?

For the project to grow and become an evident operatinal model the skills andassistance required would be :
1- Data minning.
2- Project planning.
3- Data collection and seeking approval from all high commissions.
4- High level security for users to log in one time with a CODE and can not re-enter any data.
5- High level of governance and IT framework with strong cloud based storage to ensure data is restricted and protected.
